# 🧬 Single-Cell Characterization of EMT Programs in Human Meningioma

This repository contains a fully reproducible single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis pipeline developed to investigate the **epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)** program in human meningioma. The analysis integrates multiple patient samples, identifies EMT-driven cellular states, characterizes differential gene expression, performs pathway enrichment, and reconstructs pseudotime trajectories to understand EMT progression at single-cell resolution.

All analyses are performed in **R**, using well-established frameworks including **Seurat, DoubletFinder, SingleR, Monocle3, fgsea**, and **msigdbr**.

## 📘 Scientific Background

EMT is a fundamental cellular program that enables epithelial cells to acquire mesenchymal features, contributing to:

- tumor invasiveness  
- therapeutic resistance  
- cellular plasticity  
- metastatic potential  

Although EMT is known to play important roles in many cancers, its contribution to **meningioma heterogeneity and progression** remains poorly understood.

Single-cell RNA-seq provides the resolution needed to:

- Quantify EMT activation per cell  
- Identify EMT-high tumor subpopulations  
- Map EMT progression via pseudotime  
- Characterize biological pathways underlying EMT states  

This repository documents an end-to-end computational workflow designed to accomplish these goals.

## 📂 Dataset

- **GEO Accession:** [GSE183655](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE183655)  
- **Tissue:** Human meningioma tumors  
- **Technology:** 10x Genomics Chromium  

Raw data are not included in this repository and must be obtained from GEO.

# 🔁 Complete Analysis Workflow (Summary)

### **1. Data Import & Preprocessing**
- Load raw 10X matrices  
- Create per-sample Seurat objects  
- Merge samples; extract patient, region, and barcode metadata  
- Compute QC metrics (UMIs, genes, mitochondrial %)  
- Apply filtering thresholds (nUMI, nGene, mito%)  

**Tools:** Seurat  

---

### **2. Doublet Detection & Removal**
DoubletFinder was applied **independently to each sample**:

- Parameter sweep to determine optimal **pK**  
- Estimated doublet rates per sample  
- Removal of predicted doublets  
- Reconstruction of a clean merged object  

**Tools:** DoubletFinder, Seurat  

---

### **3. Batch Correction & Sample Integration**
Anchor-based integration was performed to harmonize expression across patient samples:

- Variable feature identification  
- Anchor discovery  
- Integrated data construction  
- PCA and UMAP embedding  

**Tools:** Seurat (FindIntegrationAnchors, IntegrateData)  

---

### **4. Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering**
- Perform PCA  
- Construct shared nearest-neighbor graph  
- UMAP visualization  
- Clustering at multiple resolutions  
- Cluster–sample comparison  

**Tools:** Seurat  

---

### **5. EMT Scoring**
A curated set of EMT hallmark genes was used to compute EMT module scores:

**Genes:**  
`VIM, FN1, ZEB1, SNAI1, SNAI2, CDH2, TWIST1`

Cells were stratified into:

- **EMT_high**  
- **EMT_low**

This classification served as the foundation for downstream comparisons.

**Tools:** Seurat (AddModuleScore)

---

### **6. Differential Expression: EMT_high vs EMT_low**
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were computed to identify signatures associated with EMT activation.

Outputs include:

- log2 fold changes  
- adjusted p-values  
- top EMT markers  

**Tools:** Seurat (FindMarkers)

---

### **7. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) — COMPLETED**
To interpret EMT-associated DEGs functionally, GSEA was performed on a ranked gene list using **Hallmark pathways** from MSigDB.

**Enriched pathways in EMT_high cells:**

- **HALLMARK_EPITHELIAL_MESENCHYMAL_TRANSITION**  
- **HALLMARK_TGF_BETA_SIGNALING**  
- **HALLMARK_HYPOXIA**  
- **HALLMARK_INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE**  
- **HALLMARK_IL6_JAK_STAT3_SIGNALING**  
- **HALLMARK_TNFA_SIGNALING_VIA_NFKB**  

These results validate EMT activation and reveal associated signaling programs.

**Tools:** fgsea, msigdbr  
**Script:** `scripts/07_GSEA_EMT_high_vs_low.R`  

**Outputs:**
- `GSEA_results_Hallmark.csv`  
- Top 10 enrichment barplot  
- EMT hallmark enrichment curve  

---

### **8. Cell Type Annotation**
SingleR was used for automated cell type identification using the **Human Primary Cell Atlas** reference dataset.

Diagnostic evaluations:

- score heatmaps  
- delta distributions  
- confusion matrices comparing cluster identity vs annotation  

**Tools:** SingleR, celldex, pheatmap  

---

### **9. Trajectory Inference (Monocle3)**
To understand EMT progression:

1. Convert Seurat object to Monocle CellDataSet  
2. Transfer Seurat UMAP embedding  
3. Define EMT_low cells as pseudotime root  
4. Learn principal graph  
5. Order cells along pseudotime  
6. Identify genes whose expression changes dynamically along EMT progression  

This reveals transcriptional transitions underlying EMT.

**Tools:** Monocle3, SeuratWrappers
