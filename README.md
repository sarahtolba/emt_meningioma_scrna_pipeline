# ðŸ§¬ Single-Cell RNA-seq EMT Project

This project investigates the epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition (EMT) program in brain tumor samples using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). It focuses on identifying EMT-high subpopulations, characterizing their gene expression profiles, and mapping their developmental trajectories. Analyses were conducted using R and several state-of-the-art packages including Seurat, SingleR, DoubletFinder, and Monocle3.
